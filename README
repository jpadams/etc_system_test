to set this up:
1) put this directory on your master in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/.
2) in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf change the line that specifies "hiera_config" to 
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/etc_system_test/hiera.yaml (perhaps preserve old line with a comment #)
3) restart the puppet master web service to pick up the new hiera.yaml file: `service httpd restart`
4) then from a Solaris agent run `puppet agent -t --environment=etc_system_test`

note: currently hiera will use the data in "database_example.yaml" every time because of the hierarchy in the "hiera.yaml". If you'd like to try using "fqdn" (or some other fact), simply remove the "database_example" line from the yaml file (or move it below the "%fqdn" line since hiera returns the first match read top to bottom) and add a file to the "data" directory in the form "<fqdn of server>.yaml".
